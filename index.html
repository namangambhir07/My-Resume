    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    
    <p>Hi, I’m Naman Gambhir, a first-year B.Tech student with a passion for web development. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity about how websites work. As I began learning, I discovered the endless possibilities of creating dynamic, user-friendly websites, and I quickly developed a love for coding. This passion has led me to focus on web development, with the goal of mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.

        Currently, I am diving into the fundamentals of web development, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to exploring more advanced concepts. 
        <p>This website is my very first project, and I’ve put in my best effort to showcase my skills and document my learning process. Through personal projects and constant practice, I am building a strong foundation for a career in web development, with a focus on becoming a full-stack developer.
        
        I am committed to continuous growth, always exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices.</p> Whether it’s learning a new programming language or working on a new project, I believe in hands-on experience as the best way to improve. This website will serve as a place where I can share my projects, experiments, and progress, and also connect with other developers and like-minded individuals.
        
        Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope my work inspires you as much as I’ve been inspired by the world of web development. I look forward to building amazing things and continuing my journey to becoming a well-rounded web developer.</p>
